After doing SSH into the EC2 instance you need to change the user to the super user by using the command : 

#sudo su

so that you wonâ€™t have any user permission issues.


## Install NodeJS and NPM using nvm

- Install nvm (node version manager) by entering the following at the command line: ***curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash***

- Activate nvm by using: ***. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh***

- By using nvm you have to install Node.js: "nvm install node"

- Verify the nvm and Node.js installation by typing in the terminal: ***nvm --version*** then ***node -v***


## Install Git

- Install Git so that you can clone the repository containing the Node.JS app

- First update all software packages: *** yum update -y ***

- Then, install git: *** yum install git -y ***

- verify if git was installed correctly: *** git --version ***


## Clone the repository from GitHub

- Clone the repo from https://github.com/rajani103/nodejs-on-ec2

*** git clone https://github.com/rajani103/nodejs-on-ec2.git ***

- Liste the contents of the repo: *** ls -ltr ***

- Verify the folders and sub-folders


## Install all the required dependencies

- Install the dependencies: *** npm install ***


## Run the application

- It's time to run the app: *** node index.js ***





## Access the application in browser
