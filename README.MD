# AWS Projects

This repository is my collection of practical AWS projects that walk you through real-world tasks using a variety of AWS services. Each folder is a standalone hands-on project you can use to build and reinforce your cloud skills.

This repo covers different areas of AWS, organized by service category. Projects range from foundational to intermediate, and include examples using the AWS Console, CLI, Python (Boto3), EC2, S3 setup, Lambda functions, VPC, CloudFormation and cost optimization.
