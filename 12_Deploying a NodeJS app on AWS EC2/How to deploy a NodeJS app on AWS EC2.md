# Deploying a NodeJS App on AWS EC2


## Objective

This short project aimed to establish a connection between a random user and EC2, a NodeJS app and outside communication. 

The primary focus was to  deploy an application on to EC2 and expose it to the outside world. 

This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of EC2, IAM and outside application deployment strategies.


## Skills Learned

•	Advanced understanding of IAM User.
•	Proficiency in EC2 instances.
•	Ability to deploy an application on to EC2.
•	Enhanced knowledge of EC2 best practices.
•	Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in AWS services.

1. How to create a IAM USER and Login 
2. How to create EC2 Instance ? What are some of the good practices ?
3. How to access the EC2 Instance ?
4. Deploy an application on to AWS EC2 ?
5. Expose the application to outside world ?
6. Access the application deployed on AWS from your laptop.

# Tools Used

•	AWS IAM for logging purpose.

•	AWS EC2 for deploying server.

•	NodeJS for application architecture.


## Steps


### Step 1: Setting up environment locally

- Let me test locally (on my laptop directly) before deploying our app to AWS. For that reason, I am going to clone a repository containing NodeJS app from github. 

- Open your terminal and type git clone https://github.com/verma-kunal/AWS-Session.git

- Setup the following environment variables - (.env) file

DOMAIN= ""
PORT=3000
STATIC_DIR="./client"

PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""
SECRET_KEY=""

- Initialise and start the project. Type the follwing commands:
npm install
npm run start

-
