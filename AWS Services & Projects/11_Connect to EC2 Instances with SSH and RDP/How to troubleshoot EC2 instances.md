# Connect to EC2 Instances with SSH and RDP

This brief tutorial demonstrates how to establish connections to an EC2 instance using SSH and RDP, particularly useful for troubleshooting purposes.

## Background



## Prerequisite

For this project, you need:

- an AWS account. Set up a Free-Tier account www.aws.amazon.com/free

- the private key file (.pem or .ppk) associated with the instance.


## Project Outline

Establish connections to an EC2 instance using SSH and RDP.


## Stage 1: Connecting to EC2 instances via SSH


### Step 1: Log in to EC2 dashboard

- On the left side of your EC2 dasboard, click on **Instances**

- In the new interface, click on **Launch instances**

- Fill out the form by adding the name of your EC2. 


### Step 2: Create a keypair

- In the form, you have 2 options: use an existing keypair or create a new keypair. Click on **Create new keypair**.

Cheat Sheat: When creating a new key pair, select an easily memorable name. Choose a RSA key pair type and opt for the .pem key file format.

- Download your key onto your local computer. Be aware of where you save the .pem file and how you identify the key later when connecting to the instance.


### Step 3: Assign Security Groups and Ports

- Still in the same form, create a security group or select an existing one.
